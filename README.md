## 📄 Abstract

This research presents a **drone-based weather prediction system** that leverages **IoT sensor networks and machine learning algorithms** to optimize agricultural decision-making. The approach combines **real-time sensing**, **edge computing**, and **pre-trained ML/DL models** to achieve high-accuracy weather forecasts in remote agricultural areas, minimizing latency and enhancing responsiveness.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern agriculture demands precise environmental monitoring. However, **low-cost IoT devices** often lack the computational capabilities required for real-time predictions using traditional machine learning techniques. Cloud computing introduces latency, making timely actuation difficult in critical scenarios like rainfall or frost warnings.

---

## 🚁 Proposed Solution

We propose a **hybrid edge-cloud framework** where:

* Historical weather data is used to **train ML/DL models** (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.).
* These models are **deployed on edge nodes mounted on drones** to reduce latency.
* **IoT sensors** capture real-time environmental data which is processed onboard by the drone.
* The system provides **real-time actuation decisions** for agricultural automation (e.g., irrigation, pesticide spraying).
